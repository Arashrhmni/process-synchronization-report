## ðŸ”§ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and analysis of process synchronization mechanisms through a simulated print/scan job scheduler. Jobs are generated at random intervals and are executed under different synchronization techniques.

Although the source code is not included, the full report details:
- Random job generator logic
- Execution flow without synchronization (with potential race conditions)
- Implementation logic for mutexes, semaphores, and Petersonâ€™s solution
- Comparative performance and reliability analysis

---

ðŸ§  **Concepts Covered:**
- Concurrency
- Process synchronization
- Deadlocks & race conditions
- Mutex, semaphore, and Petersonâ€™s solution
- Pre-emptive task scheduling
